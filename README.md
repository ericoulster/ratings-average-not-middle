# ratings-average-not-middle
An quantative analysis indicating how people's reviews of media center around the 70% range. Datasets obtained from Kaggle. For legality reasons, I can't post the datasets used- but I can post the code used to create this analysis.

Ratings - Average is not the middle.docx is the actual analysis itself. All '.py' files are python scripts used to manipulate and visualize individual reviews.

Unfortunately, this code does not function without the individual databases, but on account of the fact that the imdb changed its policy on its previous API- I cannot post the datasets.

Analysis conducted by Eric Oulster
